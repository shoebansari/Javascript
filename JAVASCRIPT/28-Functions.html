   // a(); // works fine
   // b(); // reference error: cannot access b
    
    //1-function statement also know as function declaration.
    function a(){
      console.log('a');
    }
    //2-function expression(if fuction is created using = sign and also const and let not defined in global object)
    const b = function(){
      console.log('b');
    }

    //difference between both are hoisting function statement a is called if we call it before initialize, but will through error
    //when trying to call function expression before it initialize.

    //3-Anonymous function->can not be created like this without in other any function,
    //It will through syntax: function statement requires a function name.
    //Or anonymous function are used in values like function expression

  //  function(){
  //     console.log('c');
  //   }

  //4-Named function expression
  //similar to function expression with function name
  const c = function abc(){
      console.log('b');
      console.log(abc); // it can be accessed with that     
    }

    c();// b
    abc()//referene error

  //5-differences between parameter and aurguments

  const d = function (param1,param2){  //these are parameters
      console.log('b');
      console.log(abc); // it can be accessed with that 
      
    }

    d(10,11); // known as aurguments

    //6-first Class function(or first class citizens)->ability to pass function as argument or return a function from other function or 
    //assign a function to variable is known as first class function  .
