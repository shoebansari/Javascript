  // IIFE(Immediate Invoked Function Expression)
  // is a javascript function that runs as soon as it is defined
  // It is also knows as self executing anonymous function
  // It avoids creating global varible and function
  // As it does not define variable and function globally so there will be no name conflicts
  // Scope is limited to that perticular function if variable is difined scope would be in that function only

    //Without parameters
     //(function() {console.log('test')})()

    //With parameters
    (function(a,b) {console.log(`${a}  ${b}`)})(10,20)
