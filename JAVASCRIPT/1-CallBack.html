<!-- 
A function that is passed as an argument is know as callback function.
A Callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing, hence the name “call back”
Javascript is event driven language.This means that instead of waiting for a response before move on,
javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.

Why callback required?
javascript runs the code sequentially in top-down order.There are some cases that code runs(or must run) after something else 
happens and also not sequentially. this is called asyncronous programming.
Callback make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after a task is completed.
It helps us develop asyncrounous javascript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors.

Example below->
There is built-in function in javascript called setTimeout which calls a function after a given period
of the time. So here 'message' function is being called after 3 second. So the message function is example of callback.
