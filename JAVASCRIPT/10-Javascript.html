<!-- 
1-Javascript is synchronous language, it runs the code line by line.

2-Javascript runs on single thread. it runs code line by line and must finish executing a piece of code before 
moving onto the next.

3-Everything in javascript happens inside the execution context.
Execution context can be asssumed like a box divided into 2 parts 1 is Memory(Variable Environment) 
and 2nd is Code(Thread of execution).
Memory contains all the varibla and functions inside it. and Code is used to execute the program.
