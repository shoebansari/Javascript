    //Tempoary Dead Zone
    //console.log(a) 
    //will through references error: can not access a before initialization.
    //On breakPoint:-memory is being assigned to variable a shows undefined but no initialized, stored in separate memory(reserved for let and const)
    //not in global scope, when value is being assiged to a at that time TDZ ends
    //That phase from hoisting to assign value to variable is known as TDZ.

    //let a = 10 
    // the code between console.log(a)  to let a = 10 is known as TDZ.

    //console.log(x) 
    // Reference Error: x is not defined, means x is no where in whole scope.
    //means nowhere it is hoisted.

    //2-if there is Syntax error then no code will be executed in file.
     //console.log('sfdsfsdfs')
     //let c=10
     //let c=20;  //Or var c=20
     //will through error saying Syntax Error no any line of the code will be executed.

     //3-No Error if same name with var is declared
     var d=10
     var d=30
     console.log(d);  //30

     //4-Const, it should be initialized and declare together
     const f=10
     f=20;
     console.log(f); 
     //TypeError: assignment to const variable.
     //TypeError: type of const can not updated that's why known as type error.
