<!-- 
Var is function scoped whereas let or const is block scoped.
Var can be accessed anywhere within the function while let or const could not be accessed out of blocked scope.
If Var and let both are defined at global level, then var object is attached with window object but not let.

VAR
1-Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means that if a variable is declared anywhere else besides a function using var,
 it will always exist in the global scope.
2-Variable declared using var can be redeclared as well.

Let
1-The ES6 introduced the let keyword, which lets you define variables that are block-scoped.
2-As with variables declared with const, the variables declared with let cannot be redeclared.

Const
1-const is block-scoped. This means that the variable declared with const cannot be redeclared or reassigned.
2-declaration and assignment will be together  for const, can not only be declared.
