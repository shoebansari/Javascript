Q-1:-Primitive Data types
A:-in Javascript there are 5 primitive data types undefined,null,boolean,string,number are available.Everything
else in javascript is object or non-primitive type

Q-2:-What is javascript BOM
A:-BOM stands for Browser Object Modal that allows javascript to talk to browser.
Like Window object

Q-3:-What are the diffrent type of popup boxes are availble in javascript
A:-Alert,Confirm,Promt

Q-4:-what is console.log?
The console object provides access to the browser's debugging console.
The console object is a property of the window object.
The console object is accessed with:
window.console or just console

Q-7:-hoisting in javascript?

Hoisting is default behaviour of javascript where all the variables and functions declarions are moved on the top.
this means that irrespective of where the variable and functions are declared, they are moved on the top of the scope.
the scope can be both local and global.

ex-1
hoistedVariable = 3;
console.log(hoistedVariable); // outputs 3 even when the variable is declared after it is initialized	
var hoistedVariable;

ex-2
hoistedFunction();  // Outputs " Hello world! " even when the function is declared after calling

function hoistedFunction(){ 
  console.log(" Hello world! ");
}

ex-3
// Hoisting takes place in the local scope as well
function doSomething(){
  x = 33;
  console.log(x);
  var x;
}
doSomething(); // Outputs 33 since the local variable “x” is hoisted inside the local scope

**Note - Variable initializations are not hoisted, only variable declarations are hoisted:
var x;
console.log(x); // Outputs "undefined" since the initialization of "x" is not hoisted
x = 23;

**Note - To avoid hoisting, you can run javascript in strict mode by using “use strict” on top of the code:

"use strict";
x = 23; // Gives an error since 'x' is not declared
var x; 

Q-8:-Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
The difference between both the operators is that,“==” is used to compare values 
whereas, “ === “ is used to compare both value and types

Q-9:-Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is checked during run-time in contrast to statically typed language,
where the type of a variable is checked during compile-time.

Q-10:- Explain passed by value and passed by reference
In JavaScript, primitive data types are passed by value and non-primitive data types are passed by reference.

Q-11:- What is Polyfill?
A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers 
that do not natively support it.

Q-12:- Explain the same-origin policy with regards to JavaScript?
The same-origin policy prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries.
An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number.

An origin is defined by the scheme (also known as the protocol, for example HTTP or HTTPS), 
port (if it is specified), and host. When all three are the same for two URLs, they are considered same-origin.
For example, http://www.example.com/foo is the same origin as http://www.example.com/bar but 
not https://www.example.com/bar because the scheme is different.

Q-12:-CORS(Cross origin resource sharing)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcLW5d0KAYE

Cors is mechanism which uses additional header to tell the browser whether a specific app can share resource with another 
web app.
both the app should have diffrent origin, if they are on same origin they can share data easily

Like 
http.shoeb.in it will not allow access to https.shoeb.in or api.shoeb.in or http.shoeb.in:8080 or google.com 

A will send request to B as preflight call and the B will send reply to A with additional header whether A can acess 
to B or not, Then A can send original request to fetch or post the Data to B.

B send Header Accept-control-allow-origin if value is * means any public request can share the B server
If
B's accept-control-allow-origin:shoeb.in means onyl shoeb.in can access the B.
Sometime http method such as get,post,delete can also be restricted.

There are 2 kind of request 1 is simple request where prefligt call not used.

To Resolve this
1-Add extension from Google Crome Allow CORS
2-Put domain name in Header's accept-control-allow-origin

Q-14:- What advantages are using arrow functions?

There are two major benefits of using Arrow functions. One is that it's a shorter syntax and thus requires less code. 
The main benefit is that it removes the several pain points associated with the this operator.

Q-15:- What is the purpose of setTimeout function?
The setTimeout(cb, ms) the global function is used to run callback cb after at least ms milliseconds. 
The actual delay depends on external factors like OS timer granularity and system load. 
A timer cannot span more than 24.8 days.

Q-16:- New features added in ES6?
let, const, arrow function, map, classes, Promises, defaultParameter in function, 
String.includes(), String.StartsWith(), String.EndWith(), Array.find(), Array.findIndex().

Q-17:- How to import all exports of a file as an object.
import * as objectname from ‘./file.js’

Q-18:-List the comparison operators supported by Javascript?
>,<,>=,<=,!=,==,===

Q-19:-How do you declare variables in Javascript?
In Javascript variable are declared using the var keyword.A variable must begin with A letter, $ or _
PS: All variables in Javascript are Case sensitive.

Q-20:-What will happen if an infinite while loop is run in Javascript?
The program will crash the browser.

Q-21:-List HTML DOM mouse events?
onclick,ondblclick,mousemove,mouseover,mouseout,mouseup,mousedown

Q-22:-How to get the last index of a string in Javascript?
string.length-1

Q-23:-How can you create an array in javascript?
By Array literal
var myArray = ["1","2","3"]
By creating instance of array
var myArray = new Array()
By using an array constructor
var myArray = new Array('1','2',3)

Q-24:-How to add/remove properties to object dynamically in Javascript?
const abc={firstname:'shoeb', lastname:'ansari'}
abc.address='hardoi'
delete abc.firstname
console.log(abc)

Q-25:-How to get inner Html of an element in JavaScript?
document.getElementById("inner").innerHTML ;

Q-26:-How to clone an object in Javascript?
var x = {myProp: "value"};
var y = Object.assign({},x)
console.log(y) // {myProp: "value"};

Q-27:-What are the types of errors in javascript?

1-RangeError->
const arr = [90,88]
arr.length=90**99
console.log(arr)

will through out of range error.

2-ReferenceError->
console.log(a)  
let a =10

3-Syntax error:  
Syntax errors are mistakes or spelling problems in the code that cause the program to not execute at all or 
to stop running halfway through. Error messages are usually supplied as well.
cst a =10
console.log(a)  //syntext error

4-TypeError
const num = 123
console.log(num.toUpperCase())  //Type Error

Logical error: Reasoning mistakes occur when the syntax is proper but the logic or program is incorrect. The application 
executes without problems in this case. However, the output findings are inaccurate. These are sometimes more difficult to 
correct than syntax issues since these applications do not display error signals for logic faults.

Q-28:-DESTRUCTURING ARRAY

Befor 
const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];
const car=vehicles[0]
const truck = vehicles[1]
const suv = vehicles[2]

Now
const [car, truck, suv] = vehicles;
When destructuring arrays, the order that varibles are declared is important.

Object destructuring
const vehicleOne = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
}

const {brand, model} = vehicleOne;
console.log('brand', brand);  //'Ford'
console.log('model', model);  //Mustang

Q-29:-ES6 SPREAD OPERATOR
The javascript spread(...) operator allows to quick copy or part of existing array or object into another array or object.
1-
const numberOne = [1,2,3]
const numberTwo = [4,5,6]
const numberCombined = [...numberOne, ...numberTwo]
console.log('numberCombined', numberCombined);  //[1,2,3,4,5,6]

2-
const number  = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
const [one, two, ...rest] = number;
console.log('one',one,'two',two,'rest',rest); // one 1 two 2 rest [3,4,5,6]
     
3-
Spread Operator with object
const myVehicle = {brand:'Hydai', color:'Red', model:'2021'}
const updatedVehicle = {number:'1023', size:'L1'}
const combineVehicle = {...myVehicle, ...updatedVehicle}
console.log(combineVehicle); // { brand: 'Hydai',color: 'Red',model: '2021',number: '1023',size: 'L1' }

const spreadFun = (...inputs)=>{
  console.log(inputs) //[1,2,3,4,5]
  console.log(...inputs)  //1,2,3,4,5
}
spreadFun(1,2,3,4,5)

Q-30:-ES6 DEFAULT PAREMETER

  const defaultFun=(a=1,b=1)=>{
      return a+b
  }
  console.log(defaultFun(1,2))  // 3
  console.log(defaultFun(10))  // 11

Q-31:-Template literals
// using backtik for template literals or template string
const age =32
console.log("My name is shoeb"+"My age is:"+ age)
console.log(`My name is shoeb My age is: ${age}`)  

Q-32:-Swaping values using destructure

let a=10;
let b=20;

before
let temp=a
a=b
b=temp
console.log('a',a,'b',)

Now
[a,b]= [b,a]
console.log('a',a,'b',b)

Q-33:-unshift
This method is functional at the starting of the array, unlike the push(). It adds the desired number of elements to the top of 
an array.
var name = ["john"];
name.unshift( "charlie" );
name.unshift( "joseph", "Jane" );
console.log(name);  // [" joseph ,"," Jane ,", " charlie ", " john "]
